# 👋 Hi, I'm Will

## 🔭 A bit about me

🎓 Graduated in Physics  
📚 Passionate about learning and teaching  
🔎 Obsessed with understanding how things really work  
🌱 Technology enthusiast who recharges in nature  
🎸 Terrible acustic guitar player — but still trying  

I see the world through systems, patterns, and first principles.

Sometimes it starts with physics:

$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

Or with optimization:

$$
\nabla f(x) = 0
$$

Or simply trying to minimize complexity:

$$
\min \; Waste \quad \text{s.t.} \quad Maximum\;Value
$$

## 🚀 What I Do

I design and build:

- Scalable Data Pipelines
- Distributed Processing Systems (Spark)
- Data Quality Frameworks
- Metadata-Driven Architectures
- BI Models focused on performance and clarity
- Optimazation using math

## 📈 What Drives Me

I love understanding:

- How distributed systems actually work  
- Why performance bottlenecks happen  
- How to automate repetitive work  
- How to extract maximum value from minimal resources  

Technology is just applied physics at scale.

## 🌎 Outside Work

You'll probably find me:

- Reading about systems thinking  
- Walking in nature  
- Studying something completely new  
- Or playing guitar badly but enthusiastically
